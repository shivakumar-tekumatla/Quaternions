# Quaternions
This is a note for what quaternions represent. 

Get the rotation in axis-angle representation: 
Rotate $\theta$ with respect to $x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k}$ vector. 
Simple quaternion conversion for that rotation would be :

Take the unit vector of this axis: 
$M = \sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)$
$w = \cos(\theta/2))
$
